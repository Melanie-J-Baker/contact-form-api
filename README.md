# contact-form-api

Contact form API created using Express and MongoDB. Nodemailer and Mailtrap were used to send an email to my email account when a message is sent from a contact form (message is also added to MongoDB database using Mongoose). 

Used on my portfolio site as a backend to my contact form. See here: https://melanie-j-baker.github.io/portfolio/#contact
